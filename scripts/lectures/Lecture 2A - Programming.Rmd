## Overview

To run the code in this file, rather than copying and pasting in the console, put your cursor on the line you want to run and hit Command Enter (on a Mac) or Control Enter on PC. If you want to run multiple lines of code at once, you can highlight those lines and use the keyboard shortcut.


## Getting help

A reminder! Help is always a good thing

```{r help}
x = matrix(c(2, 1,-1, -1, -1, 1, -1, -5, -5, 10, 2, 2, 2, 2, -8), byrow=TRUE, ncol=5)

# Want the reduced row echelon form? 
# Can't find it? What do we do?!?

?rref #try to search help, the single question mark doesn't work
??rref #searches all documentation, we find it in the pracma package
??"row echelon" #also finds it - if you're not sure what the function name is you can search as a 
#string! The help window tells us what we want is in the pracma package.

#install.packages("pracma")
library(pracma)
rref(x) #only one piece of unique information in this matrix (not surprisingly since the rows
#are identical!)

```

## Random numbers
```{r Random numbers}

## RANDOM NUMBERS
runif(1) # generates 1 random number from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1 (as defaults)
runif(2, min=3, max=5) # generates 2 random numbers from a uniform distribution from 3-5

# NOTE: The magical up arrow!
# can hit the up arrow and run this again and again - draw lots of samples of 2
# can hit the up arrow and change things:
# up arrow gives you this runif(2, min=3, max=5) if you haven't yet run the line, you can edit
# any of the values.

# sample gives whole numbers
sample(1:10,3) # without replacement
sample(1:10,3,replace=TRUE) # keep running this you might get a couple #s that are the same
sample(1:5, 300, replace=TRUE) # more likely to get numbers that are the same since it's a bigger sample

# can create a matrix of random numbers
x <- matrix(runif(100), ncol=1) # 100 row, 1 column vector of random numbers from a uniform dist.
x <- rnorm(5000) # 5 numbers from a normal dist. w/ mean=0 SD=1
mean(x)
# can set parameters of the normal distribution
x <- rnorm(1, mean=100, sd=15) # draw one number from normal dist. w/ mean=100, SD=15 (e.g., 1 IQ score)

```


##Flow control

These are general programming tools that are available in many languages including R. You can do quite a few amazing things with just these simple things:
 * if/else statements
 * for loops
 * logical (boolean) operators
 
 Logical operators:

```{r logic}

a = 3 #assigning a value of 3 to a
a <- 3
3 -> a

a==3 #does a equal 3? YES
a==4 #does a equal 4? NO

a=4 #if I do this
a == 4 #now a is equal to 4
a == 3 #...and not equal to 3
a != 4 #is a NOT equal to 4? NO
a != 3 #is a NOT equal to 3? YES

# < and > (tip - the PacMan wants to eat whatever is bigger, e.g. 4>3 or 5<10)
# <= >= less than or equal to and greater than or equal to
```

If/Else statements: a rake in the garden of forking paths

Basic structure of "if" statements:
  if (LOGICAL CONDITION IS TRUE) {
    DO SOMETHING }
  else if (OTHER LOGICAL CONDITION) {
    SOMETHING ELSE }
  else {
    (a third possibility) }


```{r ifelse}
#get a random number from a uniform distribution
x <- runif(1)
x

#if this number is greater than .5 print "it's heads", less than .5 print "it's tails"

x <- runif(1)
x


if (x>.5) {
  print("It's heads!")
} else {
  print("It's tails.")
}


x <- runif(1)

if (x<(1/3)) {
  print("It's a one!")
} else if (x<(2/3)) {
 print("It's a two!") 
} else {
  print("It's a three!")
} 

#can do this over and over again using up arrow
```

For loops: do the same operation to a variable a fixed number of times

Basic structure:

for (VARIABLE in VECTOR) {do this thing, where VARIABLE changes each iteration through the loop}

```{r for loops}

#simple for loop
for (i in 1:5) { print( paste("i=", i) ) }

x = 0
for (i in 1:10) {
  x = x+i
  print(x) }

data = c(6,NA,3,7,3,NA,8)
n_trials = length(data)

for (trial in 1:n_trials) {
  if (is.na(data[trial])) {
    data[trial] = -1
  }
}

data

# Here is another way of accomplishing that same thing

data = c(6,NA,3,7,3,NA,8)   # Restore "data" to what it was before
is.na(data)  # Show us what the 'is.na()' function does

# Now, set all of the "TRUE" spots within data[] to be -1
data[is.na(data)] = -1
data

# for each value, 1 thru 5 print i=that value

#nested for loops

#first, create a matrix
x <- zeros(3,4)  #3x4 matrix of zeros

for (r in 1:3)  {    #for every row from 1-3, starting with first row
  for (c in 1:4)  {  #go column by column (in that row) starting with 1
    x[r,c]=r*10+c       #the value that goes into that spot is rows + columns
  }
} #make sure you have the appropriate number of brackets

#check out the matrix now
#it shows each value in the matrix as the row number plus the column number

#another example of a for loop

for(n in c(5,10,20,100,10000)) {
  x=runif(n)
  print(sd(x))
}
```

## Example simulation 1

I have heard that we can use the binomial distribution to figure out probabilities of count variables. For example, if I want to know the likelihood of getting exactly 8 heads out of 10 coin flips, I can look it up in the binomial probability distribution function, which simply follows the formula:

![Binomial density function](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Math/immath/bindiscom.gif)

```{r}
dbinom(8,10,0.5)
```

But now suppose I don't trust the dbinom() function for whatever reason, and I want to check it myself. How could I do that?

Well, I could flip 10 coins a bunch of times - like a TON of times - and count how many times I get 8 heads. We can use for loops for that!

As a first step, I could figure out how to just flip 10 coins. We can use the sample() function for that, where 1 = heads and 0 = tails:

```{r}
one_try = sample(0:1,10, replace=TRUE)
one_try
```

Now, I can figure out the number of heads by counting the "1"s, or just summing up the sample:

```{r}
nHeads = sum(one_try)
nHeads
```

OK, now that we have a way of counting heads from a set of 10 flips, we need to repeat that process. We'll use a "for" loop for that:

```{r}

for (samples in 1:1000000) {
  one_try = sample(0:1,10, replace=TRUE)
  nHeads = sum(one_try)
}

```

The problem here is that this is running the two lines of code _one million_ times but not actually saving the output anywhere. To do that, we need to create a *storage variable* - somewhere to stick the data. So let's create one, "storage"

```{r loop with storage}

storage = vector()

for (samples in 1:1000000) {
  
  #First, flip 10 coins
  one_try = sample(0:1,10, replace=TRUE)
  
  #Second, count how many heads there are
  nHeads = sum(one_try)
  
  #Third, put the count for "one_try" into the storage var
  storage[samples] = nHeads
  
}

hist(storage)

```

OK, that seemed to work! Now we just need to figure out how many times we got 8 heads. One way to do this would be to loop through (using a for loop!) and then use if
```{r summing8s}

nEights = 0
for (headCounts in 1:1000000){
  if (storage[headCounts]==8) {nEights = nEights+1}
  else { nEights = nEights }
}

nEights

```

A simpler way to do this same thing would be to use a logical statement and sum
```{r counting8s}

nEights = sum(storage==8)
nEights

```

So, our observed probability of 8 heads out of 10 coin flips is:
```{r pobs}
pobs = nEights/1000000
```

And our probability from the built-in function was:
```{r ppred}
ppred = dbinom(8,10,0.5)
```

How'd we do?
```{r compare}
pobs
ppred
```
Not too shabby! We can get a measure of accuracy by comparing those two numbers:
```{r accuracy}
accuracy = pobs-ppred
accuracy
```

Now, suppose we want to see how that accuracy changes as a function of the number of times we flip 10 coins. (Remember, the first time around we did it a million times.) How would you do that?

Well, we would *embed our for loop in _another_ for loop*!
```{r for for}

number_of_sets = c(5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2000, 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000, 1000000)

accuracy_of_set = vector()

for (set in 1:length(number_of_sets)) {
  
  storage = vector()
  
  for (samples in 1:number_of_sets[set]) {
    one_try = sample(0:1,10, replace=TRUE)
    nHeads = sum(one_try)
    storage[samples] = nHeads
  }
  
  nEights = sum(storage==8)
  phat = nEights/number_of_sets[set]
  ppred = dbinom(8,10,0.5)
  accuracy_of_set[set] = phat-ppred

}

accuracy_of_set
```

And we could even plot it:
```{r plot accuracy as number of sets}
plot(log(number_of_sets), accuracy_of_set)
``` 


## Example simulation 2

Another thing you can do using the same basic logic is to run a permutation simulation to empirically derive the null sampling distribution of a test statistic. For instance, recall the simple two-groups t-test we worked on in the first two lectures:

Group 1: 1, 2, 3, 4
Group 2: 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, suppose we didn't know what a t-test was and so had no idea what the t-distribution looked like. How could we test the difference between these two groups?

Start by remembering that this situation has two variables, a DV (numbers 1:8) and an IV (binary group assignment):

```{r data into a df}
df = data.frame(DV = 1:8, IV = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1))
df
```
We can estimate the difference between the two groups by comparing the means:

```{r comparing groups}

group_diff = mean(df$DV[df$IV==1]) - mean(df$DV[df$IV==0])
group_diff
```

Under the null hypothesis, there is no difference between the groups _because they are drawn from the same distribution_. That means that -- under the null -- the binary IV is meaningless. Which means that we can freely shuffle the assignment accordingly. We can use the `sample` function to accomplish this:

```{r random permutation}
permutation_of_DV = sample(df$DV, replace=TRUE)
permutation_of_DV
```

Once we have that, we can repeat the group comparison, this time with a shuffled IV, which we can think of as an independent variable drawn from the null distribtion (where there is no true difference between the groups):

```{r comparing shuffledroups}

group_diff = mean(permutation_of_DV[df$IV==1]) - mean(permutation_of_DV[df$IV==0])
group_diff
```

Of course, that was just _one_ random permutation. Suppose we wanted to do that a bunch of times, each time recording the group difference. If we did that enough times, we could draw a _sampling distribution_ of the mean difference under the null hypothesis:

```{r null sampling distribution}

mean_diff_storage = vector()
n_permutes = 100000
  
for (permutation in 1:n_permutes) {
  permutation_of_DV = sample(df$DV, replace=TRUE)
  group_diff = mean(permutation_of_DV[df$IV==1]) - mean(permutation_of_DV[df$IV==0])
  mean_diff_storage[permutation] = group_diff
}

hist(mean_diff_storage)

```

Finally, we might want to add a nice vertical line showing where our observed sample difference is and we can calculate its percentile:
```{r observed-vs-null-dist}

hist(mean_diff_storage)
group_diff = mean(df$DV[df$IV==1]) - mean(df$DV[df$IV==0])
abline(v = group_diff, col="red", lwd=3, lty=2)

# Calculate percentile
n_greater = sum(mean_diff_storage>=group_diff)
percentile = n_greater / n_permutes

print(paste0("The probability of drawing two groups with the observed difference or larger is ", percentile))

```

## Plotting

Rudimentary plots

```{r plotting}

# get some data and plot it
plot(sin(seq(-pi,pi,.01))) # plot the sin of every value in the sequence between -pi and pi

# could just as easily plot 1 to 10
plot(seq(1,10,1))

# plot that as a line
plot(seq(1,10,1), type='l')

# can plot 2 graphs on the same plot
# get some data 
x <- seq(-pi,pi,.01)

# create one plot
plot(x,sin(x))

# keep the plot open to overlay something else
par(new=TRUE)

# plot another graph in a different color so we can easily see the two different graphs
plot(cos(x), col="green")

# here's another way to do it
lines(tan(x),col="blue") #puts things in same plot, but doesn't overwrite

# get a different x
x <- rnorm(100, mean=100, sd=15) #100 values from normal dist. w/ mean=100, SD=15
# can check mean and sd of our sample
mean(x)
sd(x)
# pretty close to the parameters we set because the sample size is large 
# probably wouldn't be as close if sample size was 5

# get a histogram of x
hist(x)

# can do fancier stuff
hist(x,20) # histogram of x with 20 bins
hist(x,20, xlab="IQs", main="Histogram of IQs") #title and axes

# line graphs
x <- seq(-3,3,.01)
plot(sin(x)) # we already saw this above

# can give values for the x and y axis
plot(x,sin(x))

# Sometimes it's easier to plot things using colors instead of numbers
design = matrix(c(sin(x),cos(x)), ncol=2)
image(design)
image(design,main="my design", col=terrain.colors(1000))

# now let's look at bar plots - get some categorical data
x <- c(10,8,7,7,5)
barplot(x,main="Some RTs", xlab="Group")

## NOTE: lots of different things you can do with plots
## harding.edu/fmccown/r/#linecharts

# label the bars
barplot(x,main="Some RTs", xlab="Group", names.arg=c("One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five"))

# add some color
barplot(x,main="Some RTs", xlab="Group", names.arg=c("One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five"), col=rainbow(5))

# add a legend (probably don't really need this here since bars are labeled...)
legend("topright", c("One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five"), cex=0.6, bty="n", fill=rainbow(5))


## LINE GRAPHS w/ fancy-ish stuff

# compare cars and trucks
cars <- c(1,3,6,4,9)
trucks <- c(2,5,4,5,12)

# make a graph for cars. using points connected by a line, y axis ranges from 0 to 12.
plot(cars, type='o',col="blue",ylim=c(0,12),ann=FALSE)

# ann=FALSE means that R shouldn't label the axes, asking it not to automatically label the y axis right now
# because it would just be labeled cars and we want to plot trucks, too.

# graph trucks on the same plot w/ a red dashed line and square points
lines(trucks, type='o',pch=22,lty=2,col="red")

# add a title & labels for axes
title(main="Autos",col.main="red",font.main=4, xlab="Count", ylab="Total")

```

## Input and Output

How go get data into R from the command line
```{r input}
#input 

#use readline function to get a string

#t <- readline(prompt="Give me some text:")
#now t is whatever you told it, look at t

#t <- readline(prompt="Enter a number:")

#class(t) #note that it's not a number right now
#t+2 #can't add using t

#can change the class of the variable
#t <- as.integer(t)
#class(t)
#t+2 #now can add the numeric variable

#t2 <- as.integer(readline(prompt="Give me a number:"))
#class(t2) #it's already an integer!
```

Output: How to get R to present data to you
```{r output}

#use print to write text to the screen
print("You entered:")

#...and you can use paste to merge text and variables
print(paste("You entered", 5))

#...so we can combine these two things
#x <- readline(prompt="Enter a number:")
#print(paste("You entered", x))
```
