```

## Define the variables
```{r Definitions}
y = c(1:10)   # DV
x = c(rep(0,5), rep(1,5)) # IV

# X as a factor
X = factor(x, labels=c("Group 1", "Group 2"))
X

```


## First, fit a simple linear model
```{r Linear model}

# Fit a linear model (i.e., SOLVE FOR B, E)
oneWayANOVA = lm(y ~ X)

# Report the ANOVA table (df, SS, MS, F, p-val)
results = anova(oneWayANOVA)
results

```

## Pull out the ICC

ICC = the sum-of-squares attributed to the model divided by the total sum-of-squares
```{r ICC calculation}
ICC = results$`Sum Sq`[1] / sum(results$`Sum Sq`)
ICC
```
